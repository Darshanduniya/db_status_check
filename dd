Business Justification: Mounting the /data/darshan directory on the 2304 server centralizes data access, enhancing operational efficiency and team collaboration. This setup facilitates easier data management and improves overall productivity.

Risk of Doing This Change: Potential risks include temporary downtime during the setup process and the possibility of configuration errors that could disrupt data access. Additionally, there may be security vulnerabilities if not properly managed.

Risk of Not Performing This Change: Without this change, data fragmentation could occur, leading to inefficiencies and decreased productivity. The team may face challenges in accessing and managing dispersed data, which can hinder collaboration and decision-making.

Impact on ILD Environment: The change should have minimal impact on the ILD environment if executed correctly. Proper planning and testing are essential to ensure compatibility and stability, preventing any adverse effects on existing operations.
