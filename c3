Architecture-Level Differences:
Local Executor:
Single-Machine Execution: All tasks are executed in parallel on the same machine where the scheduler is running, utilizing the local resources (CPU, memory) of that machine.
Celery Executor:
Distributed Execution: Tasks are distributed across multiple worker nodes, coordinated through a message broker (like RabbitMQ or Redis), allowing for horizontal scaling and higher concurrency.
