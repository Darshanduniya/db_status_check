Transition Plan: From Local Executor to Celery Executor in Airflow
Current Setup and Testing:

Local Executor: Airflow has been configured to use the Local Executor.
Startup via systemctl: Airflow services are managed and started using systemctl.
Testing: Multiple DAGs have been tested, and Airflow is working fine in this setup.
Planned Transition to Celery Executor:

Celery Executor: We plan to transition to the Celery Executor for better scalability and distribution.
Message Broker: Redis will be used as the message broker to manage task queues.
Monitoring Tool: Flower will be employed to monitor the Celery workers and tasks.
Initial Issues and Rectification:

Connection Errors: During the initial setup of the Celery Executor with Redis, connection errors have been encountered.
Resolution: These errors are being actively addressed and rectified to ensure a stable setup.
Testing Celery Executor:

Comprehensive Testing: Once the connection issues are resolved, we will conduct thorough testing of the Celery Executor to ensure it works as expected.
DAG Migration Plan:

Source Server (2333): Current DAGs are hosted on the server with IP 2333.
Destination Server (2444): DAGs will be migrated to the new server with IP 2444.
Pre-Migration Checks:
Script Paths: Verify that all script paths are correctly configured on the new server.
Necessary Configurations: Ensure all required configurations and dependencies are in place.
Communication:

Email Alerts: Proper email alerts will be sent to all relevant stakeholders before the migration begins to inform them of the planned changes.
Migration Execution:

DAG Migration: Migrate the DAGs from the 2333 server to the 2444 server.
Starting New Airflow Instance: Launch the new Airflow instance on the 2444 server.
Production Designation:

New Production Environment: The new Airflow setup on the 2444 server will be considered the production environment after the migration is successfully completed.
