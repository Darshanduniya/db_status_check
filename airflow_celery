Transition from Local Executor to Celery Executor in Airflow
Currently, we have been using the Local Executor for Airflow, which has been started using systemctl. Our testing with multiple DAGs has confirmed that Airflow is functioning properly in this setup.

However, we are now planning to transition to using the Celery Executor, with Redis as the message broker and Flower for monitoring purposes. During our initial setup, we encountered some connection errors, which we are in the process of rectifying.

Once we have successfully tested the Celery Executor setup, we will plan the migration of DAGs from the server with IP 2333 to the server with IP 2444. This migration will be carried out with proper email alerts to notify relevant stakeholders. Before proceeding with the migration, we will ensure that all script paths and necessary configurations are correctly set.

Following the migration, we will start the new Airflow instance on the 2444 server and designate this instance as our production environment.

Transition Plan: From Local Executor to Celery Executor in Airflow
Current Setup and Testing:

Local Executor: Airflow has been configured to use the Local Executor.
Startup via systemctl: Airflow services are managed and started using systemctl.
Testing: Multiple DAGs have been tested, and Airflow is working fine in this setup.
Planned Transition to Celery Executor:

Celery Executor: We plan to transition to the Celery Executor for better scalability and distribution.
Message Broker: Redis will be used as the message broker to manage task queues.
Monitoring Tool: Flower will be employed to monitor the Celery workers and tasks.
Initial Issues and Rectification:

Connection Errors: During the initial setup of the Celery Executor with Redis, connection errors have been encountered.
Resolution: These errors are being actively addressed and rectified to ensure a stable setup.
Testing Celery Executor:

Comprehensive Testing: Once the connection issues are resolved, we will conduct thorough testing of the Celery Executor to ensure it works as expected.
